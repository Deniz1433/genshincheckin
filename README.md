Does your Genshin Impact and HSR Daily Check-in web events for you

Make sure to add a name and a cookie to the sign event functions. The name is used to create a 'namelog.txt' file which logs the "Ok" or "Traveller, you've already checked in today" responses and their dates from the server.
This version of the program should be ran once a day, I have it set as a cron job on my Linux cloud computer with the cookies of a few friends which does exactly that, but you could also use Windows task scheduler on your own computer too to automate this. You could also modify the code by adding a loop that runs the sign event functions once a day, so instead of having to run the program once a day you'd only have to run the program once but then keep it running for it to work.
